    "The essential libraries used in this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`pandas`**: The core library for efficient data manipulation and analysis, primarily through DataFrames.\n",
    "* **`numpy`**: The fundamental package for numerical computing, used for working with arrays and mathematical functions.\n",
    "* **`matplotlib`**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.\n",
    "* **`seaborn`**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n",
    "* **`geopandas`**: Extends pandas to enable spatial operations on geometric types, crucial for handling and analyzing geospatial data.\n",
    "* **`folium`**: A powerful library for visualizing geospatial data on an interactive Leaflet map."
